# CarRentalCo

This repository contains CarRentalCO project. It's my first attempt to write project with Domain Driven Design approach.
It's also a workspace to practice microservices, CQRS, messaging (RabbitMQ), caching (Redis & client side ETAGs) in a fully Dockerized Environment!
  Additionally this project is used to make tests / studies about Microservicese scalibility & resilence in a Kubernetes Cluster for my Thesis.
